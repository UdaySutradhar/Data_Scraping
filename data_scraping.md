Weather Data Scraping
This project demonstrates weather data scraping using a command-line interface (CLI) and a Flask-based front-end. It allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific location, including the description, temperature, humidity, and timezone.

-:Tech Stack:-
1.Python: Programming language used for the CLI and Flask app
2.Flask: Web framework used to create the front-end interface
3.geopy: Python library for geocoding and getting location data
4.requests: Library for making HTTP requests to retrieve weather data
5.BeautifulSoup: Library for parsing HTML data (optional for web scraping)
6.argparse: Library for parsing command-line arguments

-:Features:-
1.Retrieve weather information for a specified location
2.Display weather description, temperature, humidity, and timezone
3.Command-line interface (CLI) for direct usage
4.Web interface built with Flask for easy interaction

Usage

1.Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/weather-data-scraping.git](https://github.com/UdaySutradhar/Data_Scraping.git)

2.Run the Flask front-end:
python app.py

3.Access the weather scraping form:
Open your web browser and go to an url like this 'http://localhost:5000', which will be shown when flask front end is run. Enter the location and select the desired weather options. Click "Get Weather" to retrieve the weather information.
