# Data_Scraping

Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

1.The code begins by importing the necessary modules, including 'argparse' for parsing command-line arguments, 'requests' for making HTTP requests to the API, 'json' for handling JSON data, and 'geopy' for geocoding the location input.
2.The 'argparse' module is used to define and parse the command-line arguments. The code defines the location argument, which represents the 'location' for which weather data should be fetched. It also defines several options like '--description','--temp', '--humidity', and '--timezone' to customize the displayed weather information.
3.The 'get_weather_data' function takes a location as input, uses geocoding to retrieve the latitude and longitude coordinates, and makes a request to the Weatherstack API using the provided API key. The API response is parsed as JSON, and the resulting data is returned.
4.The code retrieves the weather data for the specified location using the 'get_weather_data' function and stores it in the 'data' variable.
5.Based on the selected options, the code checks if the requested weather information is available in the 'data' dictionary and prints it accordingly. If the data is not available, appropriate error messages are displayed.
6.The program also handles cases where no options are provided, prompting the user to select at least one option.
7.Finally, the code executes the main logic based on the command-line arguments and displays the requested weather information.

To use the code, you can run it from the command line and provide a location along with any desired options. For example:

python a.py "New York" --description --temp

This would fetch and display the weather description and temperature for New York.
